# Thoughts

## Day 2

I'm disappointed that this was the solution I chose because regex/string
comparison would have been much easier to implment.

## Day 7

I could have combined the 2 functions but was too lazy

## Day 9

Part 2 is a weird geometry problem... Why

## Day 10

I can't believe there's an NP hard problem here! I wonder if bidirectional BFS
with a smart branch-and-bound would have been enough. Using a constraint solver
felt like cheating here.
